        <p>My concept is just a basic chat game, where you talk with an NPC.</p>
        <p>It will use variables for keeping track of certain answers - as booleans is my current thought.</p>
        <p>Comments will be throughout to explain what each thing is for. (vars, functions, etc)</p>
        <p>It will use operators to check the state of variables.</p>
        <p>There will be different functions called based on the player's variables.</p>
        <p>There will be at least one object - the NPC. There may be more for items.</p>
        <p>Events will be triggered by buttons on the HTML page.</p>
        <p>Strings will be used as dialogue and to update the HTML page.</p>
        <p>Arrays may be used for randomization options.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Having a very in-depth game based on chatting with an NPC may be difficult,
             but I hope to at least demonstrate that I can use each of the required elements.</p>
